# Backend Backup - Supabase Migration

This folder contained the original Express.js backend that has been replaced by Supabase.

## What Was Here:
- Express.js server
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication
- REST API routes
- File upload handling

## What Replaced It:
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **APIs**: Auto-generated Supabase APIs
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Real-time**: Supabase Subscriptions

## Migration Benefits:
- ✅ No server maintenance
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Built-in security
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Global CDN
- ✅ Zero configuration

## Files Moved:
- Database schema → `supabase-schema.sql`
- Auth logic → `src/services/supabaseAuth.js`
- API calls → `src/services/supabaseLeads.js`
- User management → `src/services/supabaseUsers.js`

The backend functionality is now handled entirely by Supabase, making the application more scalable, secure, and maintainable.
